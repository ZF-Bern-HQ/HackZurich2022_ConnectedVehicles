## Visual Sensing & Vehicle Health

Superficial damage to the tires, body and undercarriage of a commercial vehicle is a problem to a fleet, causing unforeseen costs or in the worst case leading to more critical problems if not resolved.

Automated visual inspection can help catch these damages, but what does the interface between this automated system and the fleet manager look like?

Question: How might we assist a fleet manager to ​better monitor and manage the status of their vehicles?

Challenge: Develop a concept that assists a fleet manager to better understand and digitally sense the health of the fleet.

Hints:​

- Focus on identifying the right customer problem to solve, rather than jumping straight into the technical solution.​
- Consider similar approaches in other industries, could that work for this topic?​
