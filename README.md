# Challenge - Connected Vehicles for Efficiency and Sustainability


### Optimizing operations for fleets is a big challenge for fleet managers. Logistic companies are constrained by a small margin and any decision should be driven by cost and the company strategy, e.g., in sustainability.
### Use your skills to build a recommender system that helps a fleet manager to optimize the logistics operations. Collaborate with us and help increase the efficiency and sustainability of transport service. Let's do it!

The task of a fleet manager is to male sure all resources such as vehicles, and drivers have been used in an optimum way. It is often a challenge for them to access a powerful intelligent tool as a support system to help them to make the best decision. Often times there are multiple factors which play a role and would require a sophisticated intelligence to handle and analyze and provide insights. Among all, few factors to name here are: drivers’ behaviors, driving situations (highway, city, weather, geolocation, etc.), vehicle condition and type, vehicles’ fuel/battery status. Here we want you to build a solution to suggest the best combination of drivers and vehicles and driving situation for the fleet operation efficiency.

We challenge you to create a software that would help a fleet manager to be operate the fleet in a most efficient and sustainable way: Invent an intelligent algorithm for efficient operation prediction (fuel consumption as an example), paired with a frontend for visualising and recommending a best use of resources for a fleet.
